# Machine Learning Assignment - Task 2

For full details of the assignment, please see the assignment brief on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.bournemouth.ac.uk/d2l/home/142902) for the Machine Learning unit: Content --> Assessment


## Content

This repository contains the following:

* the assignment dataset (in the ``data`` folder),
* a dummy classifier (in the ``classifier`` folder) and
* a Jupyter Notebook (``ml-assignment.ipynb``) that loads the dataset, processes the dataset (prepares data structures ``X`` and ``y``), and runs the RandomClassifier.


## TASK

For full details of the assignment, please see the assignment brief on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.bournemouth.ac.uk/d2l/home/142902) for the Machine Learning unit: Content --> Assessment

In summary, you should

1. Implement a K-NN or Classifier Ensemble from scratch
2. Demonstrate it works by updating the Jupyter Notebook provided to run your classifier
3. Submit code as per below


## SUBMISSION

Clone this repository to your local disk.

Please add the python code for your classifier (in one or more python files) to this repository. You can add it to the ``classifier`` folder and use the example code for loading into the Jupyter Notebook.

Modify the Jupyter Notebook to replace the import and use of the MyClassifier with your own (see comments like ``# REPLACE WITH IMPORT FOR YOUR CLASSIFIER`` in the Python code in the Jupyter Notebook).

Ensure that it runs and generates results successfully. You should see three text outputs for accuracy, precision and recall, as well as a histogram graph.

You can ZIP the folder with these files and submit this (along with your report!).
